1)  add a Timer for capturing elapsed time
2)  make Printer module a class and instantiate it with an
    outstream so you don't have to keep calling "outstream.puts"
3)  separate out all the functions of the game class
3)  add difficulty feature
4)  add record tracking and top 10
5)  add a Rakefile so I can run all the tests
